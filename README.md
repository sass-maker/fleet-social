# Fleet Social

Private Fleet publishing hub based on [CogSend](https://github.com/deepakness/cogsend) (MIT). Fleet product feeds can create project-attributed drafts with a draft-intake key. The owner reviews the saved content and destinations before scheduling or publishing. Each account keeps its own delivery outcome; an ambiguous provider response waits for owner reconciliation in Posts.

The private Fleet Worker is deployed with isolated D1 and R2. Cloudflare Access, GitHub and Google sign-in, and one owner-connected YouTube channel are live. A private YouTube canary was published and verified on both Fleet Social and YouTube; public YouTube posting remains disabled. See [PROJECT_STATUS.md](PROJECT_STATUS.md), [issue #1](https://github.com/sass-maker/fleet-social/issues/1), and [issue #3](https://github.com/sass-maker/fleet-social/issues/3) for the rollout state.

For local code qualification, use `npm ci`, `node scripts/sync-fleet-projects.mjs` when the canonical Fleet catalog changes, then `npm test`, `npm run check`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run build`. The CogSend install and release instructions below document the upstream foundation. Fleet's instance uses its own Worker, D1, R2, and Google OAuth project; do not run the upstream setup commands against Fleet resources.

## Features

- Thread editor: one card per post, images with alt text, a Global tab plus a tab per platform
- Pasting a long draft splits it into a thread that fits the tightest platform you
  selected, counted each platform's own way (graphemes, Mastodon's URL weighting)
- Link preview cards for URLs in a post
- Publish now with per-destination results, or schedule; cancel, reschedule and retry from Posts
- Retryable failures back off on their own — five attempts, then they park in Failed
- Insights: published against failed over 7, 30 or 90 days, per-account stats and why posts failed
- Disconnecting an account removes its scheduled posts, returns drafts that were still waiting, and keeps published history
- Credentials encrypted at rest (AES-256-GCM), with 2FA on the single admin account
- Personal API key for scripts and Shortcuts (`Settings → API access`)

## Install

Needs Node 22.12+ and a Cloudflare account with Workers, D1 and R2 available. R2
asks for a payment method on file even on the free tier.

```sh
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/deepakness/cogsend.git cogsend
cd cogsend && npm install && npm run setup
```

`setup` is the whole install: `wrangler login`, the D1 database and the R2 bucket,
the secrets, your admin account, the migrations, the deploy, then one sign-in
against the live Worker to prove it works. Open the URL it prints, sign in, and
scan the QR with an authenticator app — and save the backup codes.

It is safe to re-run: resources, secrets and the account are reused, not replaced.
`npm run setup -- --dry-run` prints the plan without changing anything, and
[docs/deploy.md](docs/deploy.md#one-command) lists what it does and every flag. Lost the password or the authenticator later?
`npm run admin:reset -- --all` from your checkout
([Configuration → The login](docs/configuration.md#the-login)).

## Updating

```sh
git pull && npm ci && npm run deploy:release
```

`deploy:release` runs the tests, applies migrations, builds and deploys. Your data
is in D1 and R2, not in the checkout, so a pull cannot touch it. Settings → Instance
and `npm run doctor` both report the running version and say when a newer release
is out; [docs/deploy.md → Updating](docs/deploy.md#updating-and-rolling-back) covers
release tags and rolling back.

## Documentation

The upstream CogSend docs are also published, with search, at [cogsend.com/docs](https://cogsend.com/docs/). Fleet-specific additions in this fork remain in this repository.
