# Writing and publishing

The composer is one draft: a thread of cards, the accounts it goes to, and a
Publish button with a schedule option next to it. Everything here happens in the
browser; the same actions are available to scripts through the [API](api.md).

## Drafts save themselves

A draft is saved as you type, and **Cmd/Ctrl + S** saves it on demand. Drafts are
listed under **Posts → Drafts**, where **Edit Post** reopens one and **Remove**
deletes it. The trash button in the composer discards the draft you are on, after
asking.

## A thread is a list of cards

Each card is one post, with its own character counter and its own images.

- **+ Thread** adds a card; the × on a card removes it.
- Type `---` in a card to split it there. The text after the marker moves into a
  new card below.
- Paste a long draft and it is split for you: into a thread that fits the
  strictest limit among the accounts you picked, counted the way that platform
  counts (graphemes, and Mastodon's own URL weighting). Paste text with `---` on
  lines of their own and it splits on those instead.
- **Alt + ↑ / ↓** moves the card you are typing in up or down the thread.

LinkedIn and YouTube have no threads: text sent there is flattened into one post or video description. The
limits for every platform are in [OAuth apps → Platforms](oauth-apps.md#platforms).

## Images and alt text

Each card takes up to four images. Every image has an alt-text field ("Describe
this image…"); fill it in and it goes out with the image on platforms that
support it. Size and format limits differ per platform — Bluesky takes 1 MB, X 5
MB, and LinkedIn rejects WebP — and are checked again when the post is published.

A URL in a card shows the link preview it will produce, while you write.

## Global, and a tab per platform

The **Global** tab is the post every account gets. With more than one account
selected, **Add override…** adds a tab for one platform, where you can rewrite the
text for that platform alone — shorter for X, longer for LinkedIn — without
touching the others. An override tab is unlinked from Global from then on; its
reset button re-syncs it to the Global text.

With a Mastodon account selected, **Mastodon Options** sets the visibility
(Public, Unlisted, Followers, Direct) and an optional content warning.

With a YouTube channel selected, enter the video title and attach one MP4. The post text becomes the video description. Fleet Social currently uploads it as **Private**. Choose the Fleet project, save the exact draft, and use **Approve draft** before publishing or scheduling. Edits to the approved content, media, or destination require a fresh approval. After upload, **Posts** shows the YouTube video ID, visibility, and link.

## Choosing destinations

The accounts button in the dock (**N selected**) opens the list of connected
accounts. Tick the ones this draft goes to; **Clear all** empties the list. An
account that needs reconnecting is marked, and [Accounts](accounts.md) is where
you fix it.

## Publish now, or schedule

**Publish** sends the draft to every selected account and shows the result per
account. By default it asks first, with a **Confirm Post** step; tick **Publish
without asking next time** to skip it in this browser, and turn the question back
on under **Settings → Preferences → Ask for confirmation before publishing**.
**Cmd/Ctrl + Enter** publishes from the keyboard.

The calendar button next to it schedules instead: either **Publish in** an offset
of minutes, hours or days (one hour by default), or a **Specific Date** and time in
your own timezone. Opening a scheduled post again with **Edit Post** starts on the time it is already set for, so confirming without a change keeps it. A scheduled post waits in **Posts → Scheduled** until a
[tick](scheduling.md) publishes it.

If some accounts fail, the composer says **Couldn't publish everywhere** and lists
why; **Posts → Failed** has a **Retry** for each. A scheduled post that hits a
retryable failure (a rate limit, a platform timeout) tries again on its own,
backing off from one minute up to thirty — five attempts, then it stops in
Failed. See [Posts and Insights](posts.md).
